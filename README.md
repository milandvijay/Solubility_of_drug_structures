# Solubility Prediction Project

This GitHub repository hosts a project aimed at predicting chemical structure solubility.
Leveraging RDKit for visualization and manipulation, the project generates key molecular descriptors (MolLogP, MolWt, NumRotatableBonds, Aromatic Proportion). The resulting feature matrix is employed to develop a machine learning model for solubility prediction. the file solubility_predictions_of_structures contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, visualization, and model development.
 
Contributions are welcome through forks and pull requests. Acknowledgments to RDKit. Explore the notebooks for detailed insights into the data and model development process.
